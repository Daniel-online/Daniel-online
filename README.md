### Thanks for checking my profile!
Here, take this with you 🪬

As you can see through from my projects dashboard, i am a developer with a variety of interests. I enjoy building SAPs and APIs for the web 🌐, creating desktop webs and cli tools as well.
Sometimes i venture into frontend and sometimes into backend. That said, my professional specialization is on **Node.js** 🟩( i aim to become a core contributor to the project) and **Python** 🐍
.
I am a **Java** 🟧 explorer and a **Ruby** 🟥, **Golang** 🟦 and **Lua** 🌔 enthusiast as well. 

My journey of web development has brought me to two conclusions: we need more security on the web and we need simpler production workflows. These two statements may often conflict, but creating the balance within both is what made me interest in deep diving into everyday technology to make it better than we thought it could be.

I speak fluent portuguese 🇧🇷 and english 🇺🇸, i know medium spanish 🇲🇽 and i will be learning Hebrew for the next 3 years  

Right now i am studying for my **Node.js**🟩 certification by the _Linux foundation_ and working on BeKlube MLM startup.
Here's my [linkedin](https:www.linkedin/in/affonso-online) and my professional [email](danielourencoaffonso@gmail.com) for contact.

Have a nice coding!
